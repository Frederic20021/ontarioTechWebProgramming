<!--
        This page displays all the reviews submitted by users. Decided to creatre a separate HTML file to show reviews so it can be neater.
        Reviews are loaded from localStorage, and their content includes:
        - User name (or "Anonymous" if not provided)
        - Star rating (1-5 stars, rendered dynamically using Unicode stars from symbl.cc)
        - The written review
        - The date the review was made
        
        Features used:
        - DOM concept to load reviews from localStorage
        - Rendering dynamic content using JavaScript
        - Connection with the customers.html page using a "Write a Review >" button
        - All stars (★ and ☆) were copied from symbl.cc for an easier and aesthetic implementation
